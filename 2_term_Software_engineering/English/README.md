KFC is a great restaurant. I’ve known this place for a long time, and it still remains one of my favorite places. It is located on the corner of Nevsky Prospect and Mayakovsky Street, in close proximity to the Moscow railway station. The staff is always friendly and ready to help you with any question. I like the menu of this restaurant, it has everything from standard snacks to full-fledged lunches and desserts. I like to take fried chicken and salted French fries, which are relatively inexpensive and very tasty. You can also order food through the app or in a restaurant, then take a takeaway or eat in the hall, which is quite large and located on the second floor. There are always few people here, so there is a calm atmosphere. I would like to note that the beautiful view of Nevsky Prospect allows you to enjoy lunch. I recommend this place.

One of the most terrible places I visited was a "Retro Cafe" located in the basement at the intersection of Lermontovsky Prospect and Sadovaya Street. When you enter this cafe, you are greeted by large poorly lit rooms, battered sofas and broken tables. The staff also turned out to be extremely unfriendly and gloomy. The menu offers various types of drinks and shawarma, which are very inexpensive. I want to note that the price was justified, the shawarma tasted just disgusting. It was cold, unsalted, there was little sauce in it, and there were bones in the meat. The staff also did not attach importance to this and did not want to change the order. This is probably one of the reasons why there were absolutely no people in this place. Thus, this is the most terrible place I have ever been to, I will never come back here again and I will not recommend it to anyone.

Dear guest,

I hope this note finds you well. As you will be staying in my home while I am away, I wanted to give you some information that will help you feel comfortable and at home during your stay.

You will find everything you need in the house, including clean bedding, towels, toiletries, and kitchen supplies. There is also a TV, DVD player, and high-speed internet access.

Please feel free to make yourself at home, but I ask that you refrain from smoking inside the house. Also, please do not bring any pets with you during your stay.

I would appreciate it if you could water my plants every other day, collect the mail, and take the trash out once a week. I have left a key for you to access the storage room in case you need to use the vacuum cleaner or any other cleaning supplies.

You are welcome to use the kitchen to prepare your meals, and there are some basic supplies in the cupboards and fridge. If you need to buy groceries, there is a supermarket within a five-minute walk from the house.

There are plenty of things to do in the area, including hiking trails, parks, and museums. I have left some brochures on the coffee table to help you plan your days.

If you have any questions or concerns during your stay, please do not hesitate to contact me. I hope you have a wonderful stay in my home.

Best regards,
Vera

## Module test

I had an appointment with the dentist yesterday. I came to the dental clinic with a feeling of nervousness. The waiting room was quiet, with soft music playing in the background. After a short wait, the dental assistant called my name and I followed her into the treatment room. The dentist greeted me warmly, asked about my medical history and disturbing symptoms, and then explained the procedure in detail. Of course, the sound of dental instruments alarmed me a little, but a calm examination of my teeth by a dentist calmed me down. Throughout the visit, the dentist provided me with comfort and did not cause pain. In the end, he prescribed further treatment for me and I left the clinic with a sense of relief, grateful for the professionalism and care.
