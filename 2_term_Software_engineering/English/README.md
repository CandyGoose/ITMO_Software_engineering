Give this information:
- general atmosphere
- location
- how busy it is
- what they serve
- quality of food
- service
- friendliness
- prices
- value for money

Write about 150-180 words for both reviews.

KFC is a great restaurant. I’ve known this place for a long time, and it still remains one of my favorite places. It is located on the corner of Nevsky Prospect and Mayakovsky Street, in close proximity to the Moscow railway station. The staff is always friendly and ready to help you with any question. I like the menu of this restaurant, it has everything from standard snacks to full-fledged lunches and desserts. I like to take fried chicken and salted French fries, which are relatively inexpensive and very tasty. You can also order food through the app or in a restaurant, then take a takeaway or eat in the hall, which is quite large and located on the second floor. There are always few people here, so there is a calm atmosphere. I would like to note that the beautiful view of Nevsky Prospect allows you to enjoy lunch. I recommend this place.

One of the most terrible places I visited was a "Retro Cafe" located in the basement at the intersection of Lermontovsky Prospect and Sadovaya Street. When you enter this cafe, you are greeted by large poorly lit rooms, battered sofas and broken tables. The staff also turned out to be extremely unfriendly and gloomy. The menu offers various types of drinks and shawarma, which are very inexpensive. I want to note that the price was justified, the shawarma tasted just disgusting. It was cold, unsalted, there was little sauce in it, and there were bones in the meat. The staff also did not attach importance to this and did not want to change the order. This is probably one of the reasons why there were absolutely no people in this place. Thus, this is the most terrible place I have ever been to, I will never come back here again and I will not recommend it to anyone.
