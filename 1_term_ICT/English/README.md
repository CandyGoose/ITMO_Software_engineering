Plan:
* it is difficult to learn how to play a musical instrument
* no instrument, don’t know the notes, it takes a lot of time
* favorite songs, music society
* new people, a reason to practice, not boring

Speaking of music, it is difficult to learn how to play a musical instrument.

Many people don’t know the notes and elementary music theory, and not everyone has a musical instrument to start practicing. Furthermore, people don’t want to spend a lot of time to study.


I think a good way to learn how to play a musical instrument is to watch video tutorials and learn their favorite songs and melodies. Moreover, people can get a lot of experience by going to concerts and master classes of professional musicians. Attending music classes is also a good way because the teacher will be able to lay the foundations of playing a musical instrument. In addition, people can meet interesting people with similar musical tastes and interests.

These ways to learn are good, because people will have a reason to practice and improve in this skill. Besides, it won’t be boring to play a musical instrument with other people who can become your new friends.

Plan:
* I have exciting news
* shopping at the mall, lottery ticket
* the ticket is a winning one, the main prize
* sightseeing, trip, route
* cafe, weekend

Hi! I am writing to you after a long time. How are you doing? You won't believe what exciting news I have. I won a trip to Japan!

Earlier this month, I was walking with my classmates at the mall. We went to a clothing store, where after a long fitting I chose a few things for myself. When I paid for them, I decided to buy a lottery ticket. Although I had never bought any before.

Two weeks later, when I had already forgotten about the ticket, I accidentally came across a website where it was said that this ticket was a winning one. I was very surprised that I won the main prize - a trip to Japan!

It will take place next month and I have already written down all the sights that I want to see and made a route. I can't wait for such an experience!

I hope you will be as lucky as I was one day! What are you doing this weekend? I would like to invite you to a cafe. Write to me soon.

Best wishes,

Vera

Plan:
* my best friend
* kindergarten, school, Germany, the technical university
* the most memorable event
* the most important people

I would like to tell you about my best friend Sasha. We've known each other since kindergarten. However, now we live in different countries, keeping in touch with each other.

Sasha was born in St. Petersburg, where we first met and studied together at the same school for six years. Moreover, we attended the same music and drawing schools. However, in 2012 her mother went to work in Germany, so Sasha also moved with her. She still lives there and studies at the technical university. When she comes to St. Petersburg, we always go to the opera or ballet, and after the performance we walk around the city.

The most memorable event for me is our joint performance in St. Petersburg State Capella. That evening we danced on stage in front of a large audience and after that we partied in a cafe with a whole cake.

Sasha is one of the most important people in my life, because we overcame a lot of difficulties together and helped each other all along the way.

The Life of a blue whale

The blue whale is the largest modern animal, and also probably the largest of all animals that have ever lived on Earth. Moreover, the blue whale is one of the centenarians because its lifespan is quite long and can be ninety years. Of course, having such a long life, the blue whale has different stages in its life.

At birth, a blue whale weighs about six hundred kilograms with a length of five meters, then it grows by one and a half centimeters per day. For the most part, the females are engaged in upbringing, who feed the baby with milk throughout the year. At this time, small whales live in the lagoon, where they nap, dive and have fun, blowing geysers.

When the cub becomes stronger, he and his mother, with whom he constantly exchanges sound signals, go to the open sea, where the blue whale gradually begins to make large swims, preparing for adulthood.

The maturity of the blue whale comes at the age of fifteen, then he mostly leads a solitary lifestyle using voice signals to communicate with relatives and eating krill, which is the main food in his diet. Sometimes the blue whale feeds on larger crustaceans and small fish, but still small crustaceans predominate in the composition of the blue whale feed. As mentioned earlier, blue whales communicate using blue whale signals, these signals also help to find a partner to start a family. Blue whales migrate, despite the fact that they prefer to live in colder conditions in order to meet their partner, so their breeding process occurs in winter, in a warmer climate.

Since the whale has such an impressive size, adult blue whales have no natural enemies, but young blue whales can become victims of an attack by a flock of killer whales and humans. However, blue whales mostly die a natural death and its body gradually sinks to the bottom of the ocean, providing food for the whole ecosystem.

Blue whales are one of the amazing creatures on our planet, known for their gigantic size and long life, which is very interesting to observe and explore.
