Dear Ms. Bylinskaya,

I am sincerely interested in the possibility of joining your company as a trainee tester ([link to the vacancy](https://careers.itmo.ru/vacancy/testirovschik_stazher-2041.html)). Your company is a good place for me to grow and develop in the field of product testing. I am ready to put all my efforts and diligence into achieving your goals.

Despite the lack of extensive experience, I am aware of the importance of the role of a tester in the software development process. My academic background at ITMO University in the field of information technology, computer networks, Windows administration allow me to quickly adapt to new tasks and ensure high quality in my work. Moreover, I have been participating in the VK Testers program for several years, making reports on bugs in the system, improving the user experience with the service.

I want to note that I also have soft skills that I am constantly developing. Among them are teamwork, time management and communication skills. Moreover, I have determination and conscientiousness when performing tasks, which I consider a valuable skill when working with my colleagues.

In conclusion, I persistently strive to improve my testing skills, and I am ready to learn by working under the guidance of an experienced mentor. I am sure that I can make a valuable contribution to your project and help you achieve your goals.

I look forward to discussing my candidacy and learning more about your company. Thank you for your attention to my application and I hope for a positive response.

Sincerely,

Vera Kasianenko
